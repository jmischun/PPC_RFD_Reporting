## About the Author
JOSH MISCHUNG is an emerging Data Scientist specializing in Operations and Behavioral data mining. He has been a Lean Trainer with Rosendin Electric the last two years developing training content for Pull Planning, a hybrid of the production methodologies GTD and Kanban, and implementing Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluating Training to help quantify ROI-ROE. He was first introduced to statistical analysis during grad school. While writing his thesis about the impact of Emotional Intelligence on project performance he also studied a project procurement and delivery system that differentiates contractors by expertise through the use of dominant information and transparent risk tracking. Josh is currently applying his newly acquired data mining skills to determine the optimized crew compositions and optimal project team composition based on attributes from Positive Psychology to maximize the probability of project profitability.

## PPC_RFD_Reporting
This repository stores the Google Apps Script code that restructures data collected from the Daily PPC &amp; RFD Reporting Google Form. The restructuring of the data allows for aggregated and W.o.W. visual representation of Reasons For Delay (RFD). Resources are listed below, but some assembly is still required. If you're interested in implementing this tool on your project, or your division's projects, and would like some assistance with the assembly send me a message on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/joshuamischung).
